# Liner-Equation-Solver
I'm new to android dev. This is my experiment to solve and get the value of x, y of a liner equation by the using Cramer's rule in matrix determinant. So, if there's a bug please help me to fix it.

This is not the full application here you can found only MainActivity.java file. I've a separate app file in other git repo.
